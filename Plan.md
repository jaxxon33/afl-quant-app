# AFL +EV Betting Model - Full-Stack Implementation Plan

This document outlines a concise, step-by-step plan to build the AFL betting model and full-stack web application described in `Jackson.md`.

## Phase 1: Data Infrastructure & Acquisition
**1. Setup the Database**
- Create a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to handle complex relationships between teams, players, matches, venues, and odds.
- Define schemas for historical data, live match data, player stats, and bookmaker odds.

**2. Historical Data Pipeline (Last 3 Years)**
- Build scrapers/API integrations to collect the last 3 years of AFL data.
- **Data Points:** Match results, player stats, weather conditions, venue details, injury reports, and lineups.
- Clean and normalize this data to form the foundation of your predictive model.

## Phase 2: Predictive Modeling (The Engine)
**3. Develop the Machine Learning Model**
- Use Python (scikit-learn, XGBoost, or PyTorch) to train models on historical data.
- **Features:** Home ground advantage, player availability (injuries/lineups), weather, venue performance, and team form.
- Create sub-models for different markets: Head-to-Head, Line, Totals, and Player Props.

**4. Build the Monte Carlo Simulation Engine**
- Write an optimized simulation script (using Python/NumPy or C++) capable of running millions of game simulations.
- Output predicted probabilities for every possible match outcome and player performance metric.

## Phase 3: Live Data & Odds Integration (2026 Season)
**5. Live 2026 Match Data Feed**
- Set up automated tasks (e.g., using Celery & Redis) to fetch weekly injury reports, final lineups, and weather forecasts for upcoming matches.

**6. Bookmaker Odds Integration**
- Integrate APIs or build web scrapers for major Australian bookies (Sportsbet, TAB, Ladbrokes, Betfair).
- Standardize the odds data from different bookmakers into a single unified format.

## Phase 4: Expected Value (+EV) Calculation
**7. Build the EV Calculator**
- Compare the model’s predicted probabilities against the bookmakers' implied probabilities.
- Formula: `EV = (Probability of Winning * Potential Profit) - (Probability of Losing * Stake)`
- Calculate and assign an EV percentage (e.g., +5%, +12%) for each market. Filter out any bets that are not mathematically profitable.

## Phase 5: The Full-Stack Web App
**8. Backend API Setup**
- Build a robust backend (Python FastAPI or Django) to serve data to the frontend.
- Expose endpoints for: upcoming matches, recommended +EV bets, simulation results, and odds comparisons.

**9. Frontend Dashboard**
- Develop a responsive web application (React, Next.js, or Vue).
- Create views for:
  - **Match Dashboard:** Upcoming games with predicted outcomes.
  - **+EV Feed:** A real-time updating list of profitable bets, color-coded by EV percentage.
  - **Insights:** Detailed breakdowns of why a bet is +EV (e.g., highlighting a specific injury advantage).

## Phase 6: Automation & Deployment
**10. Cloud Infrastructure & Automation**
- Deploy the application to the cloud (AWS, GCP, or Vercel/Heroku).
- Set up a chron job/scheduler to continuously poll for odds changes and rerun simulations if a major lineup change or injury is announced.
- Implement alerting (SMS/Email/Push) when a highly profitable +EV bet (+10% or more) appears, as odds lines move quickly.
